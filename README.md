# RainbowPiano 

## Description
Evenly spaced keys makes more sense for my brain.  
And we can now afford to rainbow-color the keys!

## Instruction

## Further Work
I'd like a physical RainbowPiano such as a Steinway or the Yamaha Reface CP with fully weighted keys.  
Contact me on Reddit if you know someone who can make it.  
And, maybe we should also rainbow-color the music scores for clarity!
