# RainbowPiano 
When piano was first invented in the 1700s, they could only afford two colors - black and white.  
But now we can rainbow-color all the keys, and evenly space them!

## Further Work
Post on Reddit if you know someone who can turn a RainbowPiano into a digital piano such as the Yamaha Reface CP with fully weighted keys.  
Ever had trouble reading music scores? Maybe we should also rainbow-color them for clarity!
